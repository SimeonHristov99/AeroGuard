This; of course; requires pilots to be on an IFR flight plan or have a VFR flight plan on file; and have a transponder code and communication with ATC. For those of us who operate at this airport; we have been told by ATC that we are unable to depart IFR; unless able to climb in VMC to the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) of 2000 ft. We have been told that the reason for this is that SBJ VOR is the only IFR departure fix that has been flight tested for this airport and SBJ is within the 10NM 'no fly' ring of the TFR. This restriction is causing undue burden on the pilots wishing or needing to depart in IFR conditions from 47N. This restriction is effectively denying access to the flying public from using their own tax-payer-funded public ATC system. With the vagaries of weather reporting; this restriction is potentially encouraging unsafe practices by encouraging pilots to depart in marginal conditions in order to pick up and continue on their IFR flight plan. Anecdotally; I understand that there are other nearby non-towered airports where this same problem exists. The solution to this is to flight test one or more additional departure fixes that lie outside the 10NM TFR ring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2\n","On arrival to BWI we were cleared to descend via the ANTHM 3 RNAV arrival; landing east. As the PF I selected 4;000 (the bottom altitude at STARZ) and managed descent. Prior to EAGLL we were given a revised clearance to descend to 11;000 feet for traffic. EAGLL has a crossing restriction of below 13;000 and above 12;000. As the PF I selected 11;000 and selected open descent. Several minutes later; but still prior to EAGLL; ATC gave us yet another revised vertical clearance; to descend to 11;000; then descend VIA the ANTHM 3 RNAV arrival; landing east. So as the PF I again selected 4;000 (the bottom altitude at STARZ) and managed descent. The plane slowed its descent to 1;000 FPM as we were now below the planned descent path. The PM who was distracted with other tasks looked up and queried whether we should still be descending at a faster rate to 11;000; and suggested we do so. The clearance was a bit confusing - we were not told 'best rate' (or anything like that) to 11;000; but it seemed plausible since it was 'for traffic' so I went back out of managed descent to increase the rate of descent; planning to again switch to managed at 11;000 for the further crossing restrictions after EAGLL. At 11;000 I selected managed descent again. Between 11;000 and 10;000 (as the plane was slowing its descent rate in the transition back managed) ATC queried us if we were descending on the ANTHM 3. At that point both the PM and I noticed that there was a crossing restriction of 11;000 at ROKTT; two fixes after EAGLL. Unsure if we should climb back up to 11;000; ATC gave us a new clearance to maintain 10;000; then descend via the ANTHM 3. Personally; next time there is a confusion about a clearance I will stop all other tasks so I am not distracted. If necessary I will query ATC. Externally; ATC should not give confusing altitude clearances in a terminal environment with a high volume of traffic.    2\n","Climbing to cruise altitude Right Bleed EICAS Message followed by a Left Bleed EICAS message.
